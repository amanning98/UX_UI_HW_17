            <h2>Here’s a little bit about me, My name is Amari Manning </h2>
            <p>
                and I’ve been someone who loves creating things from drawings, animations, digital art, even candles! So, looking for a path that encourages my creativity and allows me to share it, I found UX/UI and instantly wanted this to be my gateway into the digital art world as a way of living. I have been all over America being a military kid, and I have seen so many ways of life throughout my childhood. Because of these experiences, I easily get inspired by looking around me and I try to implement them into the projects I work on and share them with others.

                Right after I graduated highschool, I went to Full Sail University for computer animation. Going to Full Sail has brought out a lot from me in terms of pushing myself, knowing how to accept criticism and use it to my advantage, and how to keep updating everything because there will always be improvements to be made, never stop improving.

            <p>
                I’ve had the amazing opportunity to become an intern for Professor Middleton, an amazing animator and was an animator for Winnie the Pooh in the 1990’s. That was one of the most encouraging moments for me in my art life because it’s very easy to want to give up after not being hired for what you went to college for. However, having this internship has taught me to not give up on improving because the days you’re not working on your future career, your goal is getting further away as well.
